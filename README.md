ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Bob! I'm the CTO at [Two Kings](https://twokings.nl), a webdevelopment agency that's based in The Hague, The Netherlands. 
Apart from that i'm developing Bolt and related packages in the Bolt ecosystem. If you'd like, you can sponsor me for [my work on Bolt](https://github.com/sponsors/bobdenotter). 

### Bolt 

Bolt is a fully open source, adaptable platform for building and running modern websites. It's built on PHP, Symfony, Doctrine, Twig, API-Platform and more. Bolt can be used as a traditional CMS or headless/decoupled. It is fully multilingual, and extensible using custom code in your projects, or through extensions installed from the Composer ecosystem.  See: https://boltcms.io
